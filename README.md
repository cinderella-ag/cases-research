In my two last years of highschool, I had a chance to carry out my own research on why people make mistakes in case identification in Russian. Under a Yandex developer supervision, I mainly concentrated on nominative and accusative case and analysed the data that had been accumulated by OpenCorpora, a Russian language text corpora, through opensource annotation. As a result, I figured out the particular characteristics of context, which seem to have forced the annotators to make mistakes in case identification.
